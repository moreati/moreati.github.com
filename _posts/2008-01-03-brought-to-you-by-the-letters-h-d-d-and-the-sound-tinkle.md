It is said there are 2 types of people:

1.  Those who perform backups.
2.  Those who've never lost valuable data.

This is wrong, I'm in a third, transitory group. I'm no longer in the
second group, but I'm not yet in the first. I resolve to join, once I
replace my ex hard disk - now a rattle. Embarrassingly, it took with it
my gpg private key & photos. Miraculously the rest of the laptop appears
to have survived. Alex Update: I did have a backup of my GPG key, panic
over.
