Here's an email I received today:

> From: meetYourmessenger \<no-reply@meetyourmessenger.com\>
> Subject: You have (1) new message from Adam Hi alex, You have
> (1) unread invitation "Hello :-)" from Adam at meetYourmessenger.co.uk
> Click here Show the message in your temporary inbox at
> meetYourmessenger.co.uk

I know an Adam on MSN Messenger, he didn't send it. Mcafee SiteAdvisor
says [all is
well](http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/meetyourmessenger.co.uk/), the
comments are less rosy. Until I see evidence otherwise, I'm treating
meetyourmessenger as dodgy.
