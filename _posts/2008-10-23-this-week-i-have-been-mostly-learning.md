-   The XBox 360
    ([Xenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon_(processor))), Wii
    ([Broadway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(microprocessor)))
    and Playstation 3
    ([Cell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor))) all use
    an IBM licensed PowerPC CPU.
-   The Ubuntu spell-check dictionary includes 'SPARCstation', but not
    'PlayStation'.
-   [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) rocks.
-   Users of IIS should *not* believe [the official
    docs](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/d52ff289-94d3-4085-bc4e-24eb4f312e0e.mspx?mfr=true)
    on HTTP Compression, instead go to [Coding
    Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000059.html).
-   MythTV has a [several second delay, changing between live
    channels](http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Frequently_Asked_Questions#When_using_live_TV.2C_why_is_there_a_delay_between_the_moment_I_change_the_channel_and_the_time_the_channel_actually_changes.3F),
    the delay is inherent to the architecture.
-   [FreeView are renumbering their
    channels](http://www.freeview.co.uk/freeview/Resolutions/BBC-and-ITV-channels-moving-into-the-800-s)
    and apparently removing friendly channel numbering from their
    broadcasts, in favour of firmware updates.
