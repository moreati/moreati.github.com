title: 'T-Mobile Web n Walk'
---

I got a new phone with [T-Mobile Web n Walk
Plus](http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/personal/pages.do/our-services/internet-on-the-move/internet-on-your-phone-and-laptop-new-customers)
today. I'm impressed, it's working better than I'd hoped. Downloads are
plenty fast with [HSDPA (3.5G)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSDPA) and
configration was bearable. Websites with a mobile variant are usable at
320x240, accessing the web on my laptop, at broadband speeds, when I
don't have broadband is incredible. However, so far I've discovered some
downsides:

1.  T-Mobile run a transparent proxy. I cannot ping remote hosts, or
    telnet to the smtp port of my email provider.
2.  The proxy recompresses JPEG images at a higher ratio. The results
    are very poor.

It beats the pants off WAP and all those walled gardens that mobile
operators seem obsessed with. True mobile internet still isn't quite
here.
