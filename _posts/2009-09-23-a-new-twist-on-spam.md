That site (address altered to protect the vulnerable) is most definitely
not hosting anti-virus. In fact it's certainly hosting malware. The page
claimed that it found 'Nuker.Win32.CGSi' in 'C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32',
on my Linux laptop. Given the site, the similarity of the email
addresses, and the impossibility of a request (virus scan without any
download) - I think both messages are part of the same phishing attempt.
Which makes this the first time I've seen a spammer have a conversion
with them-self.
