title: '"Unlimited"*'

The term "unlimited" has been stretched in various ways over the last
few years. Usually it's been qualified, limited if you will, by some
undefined fair use policy in the small print. Well now those hidden
limits are getting aired. If you squint, Tiscali's current TV ad admits
a 3 GB limit for their headline price. T-Mobile are very up front on
their [Mobile Internet
Access](http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/mobile-broadband/data-plans/pay-monthly/)
rates page, but it takes advanced double-think to state "unlimited"
within 200 pixels of the limit.

Mandatory bandwdith labelling must be just around the corner, along with
sorting out [the mess of
0870.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/29/which_0870_numbers/ "DVLA, Tiscali, Barclays rake in phoneline cash")
