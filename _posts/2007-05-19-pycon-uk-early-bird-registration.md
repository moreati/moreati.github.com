title: PyCon UK early bird registration
---

[PyCon UK](http://www.pyconuk.org "PyCon UK"), the first UK community
Python conference, is taking place in Birmingham on the weekend of 8th -
Sun 9th September 2007. [Extra early bird
registration](http://www.pyconuk.org/booking.html) ends on Monday. We're
offering both days including access to all tutorials, talks, sessions
& the conference dinner for the fantastically low price of Â£50 if you
book in the next 3 days. Registration will remain open until the first
day of the conference, but book early to save more. Proposed talks so
far include:

-   Introduction to Python for programmers new to Python
-   Introduction to PyQt GUI Programming
-   Developing with IronPython
-   An Introduction to Django
-   The Report Lab pdf tool kit

More are coming, our [call for
proposals](http://www.pyconuk.org/community/CallForPapers) is open. I
look forward to seeing you there.
