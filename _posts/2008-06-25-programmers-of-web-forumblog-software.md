Dear web 2.0 coolios, Please stop writing comment systems with
half-assed threading. I understand you had to replace all those icky
newsgroups on usenet, but you could have done a better job. Take a look
at [Google
Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/topics),
[Gmane](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.general). See how all
those conversations are nicely grouped together? See how nobody is
writing @previous\_author? Please sort it out, because the [status
quo](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/20/mackay_on_carbon_free_uk/comments/)
doesn't work.

Sincerely, Alex Willmer

P.S. To anyone commenting here: I
know I'm not eating my own dog food. I am ashamed.
