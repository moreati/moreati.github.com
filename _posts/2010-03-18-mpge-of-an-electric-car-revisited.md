title: 'MPGe of an electric car, revisited'
---

Last year in [MPGe of an electric car](2009/11/17/mpge-of-an-electric-car/)
I attempted to compare the
carbon emissions of the BMW Mini-E, and my own Ford Sport Ka. The result
was 212 g/km (30 MPGe) for the Mini-E charged from coal, and 172 g/km
for my Sport Ka (37 MPGe). In retrospect, the comparison was far too
rough to draw conclusions from. This post is an attempt to correct that.
This morning the Today Programme on Radio 4 covered the news that the
[Nissan Leaf electric car is to be built in
Sunderland](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8573724.stm). In a piece Evan
Davis asked the BBC Business Reporter whether the electric car would
really reduce carbon emissions. Here is a partial transcript:

> Evan Davis:
> :   Coming briefly back to the electric car in Sunderland. You talked
>     about the rollout of a way of getting it recharged. Nissan will
>     make much of the idea that it is a low carbon car, but of course
>     it relies on electricity, which comes from the National Grid, and
>     the National grid is powered by... whatever, coal fired power
>     stations. Is it really a low carbon car, or is it masquerading?
> John Moylan:

>     nuclear to be a big part of that, it has also announced major

This provoked a quick [AudioBoo response from Robert
Llewellyn](http://audioboo.fm/boos/106897-radio-4-and-nissan-boo).
Clearly annoyed at Radio 4 he said

Today listeners might have have left thinking that electric car
and conventional car emissions are on par, but Robert's numbers put
electric car emissions (even on coal) at half that of a Prius. There is
a clear discrepancy. In Februrary Mike Boxwell (author of [Owning an
Electric Car](http://owningelectriccar.com/)) performed a direct test.
He drove 2 conventional and 2 electric cars along the same route and
measured their respective energy use:

<param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/v/dSVc2SrXVIk"></param>
</object>

In his test the electric cars charged from the National Grid both
emitted 50 g/km, whilst the conventional cars emitted 137 and 155 g/km
tank-to-wheel. The same electric cars emitted 131 and 140 g/km charged
from coal. I compared Mike's numbers to my own to arrive at the
following tables:

|---|:--|:--|:--|
||REVA G-Wiz|Mitsubishi i-Miev|BMW Mini-E|
|Distance travelled (km)|22.6|22.6|100.0|
|Electricity used (kWh)|2.99|3.19|20.63|
|Electrical eff. (kWh/km)|0.13|0.14|0.21|
|Elec. Emissions, grid (g/kWh CO<sub>2</sub>)|375.2|351.2||
|Elec. Emissions, coal (g/kWh CO<sub>2</sub>)|1056.2|927.9|1028.8|
|Car emissions, grid (g/km CO<sub>2</sub>)|49.7|49.7||
|Car emissions, coal (g/km CO<sub>2</sub>)|140.0|131.2|212.2|

|---|:--|:--|:--|
||Toyota Aygo|Fiat Panda|Ford Sport Ka|
|Distance travelled (km)|22.6|22.6|492.4|
|Fuel used (l)|1.33|1.51|37.60|
|Fuel eff. (l/km)|0.059|0.067|0.076|
|Fuel emissions, ttw (g/l CO<sub>2</sub>)|2315.0|2314.9|2246.0|
|Fuel emissions, wtw (g/l CO<sub>2</sub>)|2789.6|2789.4||
|Emissions, ttw (g/km CO<sub>2</sub>)|136.5|154.9|171.5|
|Emissions, wtw (g/km CO<sub>2</sub>)|164.5|186.7||

The difference came down to how many units of electricity (kilowatt
hours/km) were used by the electric car. Not having one to test myself I
had used the EPA combined cycle figure for the Mini-E, which represents
a very harsh driving style with many stop-starts. Mike's direct
measurements, however used his own driving style in all cases. The EPA
figure for the Mini-E (0.21 kWh/km) is 1.5 times Mike's highest (0.14
kWh/km). Mike's test produces the fairest comparison, and it's his
numbers that should be used over my flawed comparison. It does show
though, how critical driving style is to carbon emissions. Driving an
electric car very aggressively, will make it perform worse than a
conventional car driven conservatively. Coming back to the Nissan Leaf,
why did the BBC interviewer suggest it wouldn't reduce carbon emissions?
Most likely because that's the public's impression, that the power to
charge electric cars comes mostly from coal. This impression is wrong,
as I write this only 29.5 % of electricity in the UK is coming from
coal, you can see the current [carbon footprint of the National
Grid](http://owningelectriccar.com/national-grid-electric.html) for
yourself. Robert's number of 45 g/km is correct for an electric car
charged from the UK national grid, but not for a fictional car plugging
straight into Drax or Didcot coal power station. It was 7:30 though, so
such slips are forgivable.
