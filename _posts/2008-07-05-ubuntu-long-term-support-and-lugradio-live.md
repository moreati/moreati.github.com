title: Ubuntu Long Term Support and LugRadio Live
---

My first ever LugRadio Live was [LRL
2006](http://lugradio.org/live/2006/index.php/Main_Page), which was the
perfect opportunity to pickup CDs of the [then newly
released](http://www.ubuntu.com/news/606released) [Ubuntu 6.06
LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/). My last ever LugRadio Live is
[LRL 2008](http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/), which will be the perfect
opportunity to pickup CDs of the [now newly
released](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2008-July/000112.html)
[Ubuntu 8.04.1 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/8.04/). See you there,
July 19th - 20th.
