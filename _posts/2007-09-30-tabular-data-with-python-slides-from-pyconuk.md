title: 'Tabular data with Python slides, from PyCon UK'
---

At [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org/) 2007 I gave a short talk on using
Python to deal with tabular data. The [slides, demos and
modules](/talks/Tabular%20data%20with%20Python.zip)
for my talk are available for download. There is material in the
download that I didn't present on the day. The talk covers extracting
data from various tabular data formats. This is the first step of an
[Extract, Transform Load
(ETL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract%2C_transform%2C_load)
operation. It also summaries the character of those data formats.
Comments, queries and suggestions are most welcome.
