title: 'Fitts'' Law and Minimalism vs GTK+ and Qt'
---

It all started with the Pidgin chat window, which is surrounded by
several pixels of padding. To my eyes the padding doesn't achieve
anything, it just wastes space and detracts from the clean, minimalist
lines of the Buddy List. After much fumbling, I managed to change it in
the Pidgin source code . [Bug
6987](http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/6987 "Padding around chat window is unnecessary")
with patch was duly filed. Now I've become obsessed, I'm spotting extra
borders and pixels in nearly every application on my desktop.

### Fitts' law

[Fitts'
law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law "Wikipedia article on Fitts' law")
models the effort to point at something, for instance adjusting a
scrollbar with the mouse pointer. A scrollbar at the very edge of the
screen is much easier to hit than one inset by a few pixels.
Effectively, anything at the edge of the screen has infiite thickness,
so it's very easy to hit. If there is a border surrounding the
application, when it maximized the screen edge becomes useless. Firefox,
Evolution, Gnome Terminal, Nautilus, Scite & others get this right. When
maximized their scrollbar reaches the screen edge.

Pidgin, Gedit, Synaptic, MonoDevelop, Qt Designer, Glade, Anjuta & many
more get it terribly wrong. The scrollbars are inset from the window's
edge by a few ugly, infuriating pixels. These applications need fixing
and their designers subjected to aversion therapy.

### The true culprit

In fact Pidgin and Gedit are innocent, they've been framed (so to speak)
by [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org).

[![Gnome terminal without
tabs](../../../uploads/2008/09/gnome-terminal-without-tabs.png "gnome-terminal-without-tabs")](../../../uploads/2008/09/gnome-terminal-without-tabs.png)

The
[GtkNotebook](http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk/stable/GtkNotebook.html)
widget is the multi-tabbed container for GTK+ applications, such as
these. GtkNotebook draws a thin border around anything placed on one of
it's pages, this border is unavoidably drawn when the tabs are shown.
The effect can be seen by opening a new Gnome Terminal, maximizing it,
then opening a new tab. The scrollbar shifts inward by a few pixels.

tabs](../../../uploads/2008/09/gnome-terminal-with-tabs.png "gnome-terminal-with-tabs")](../../../uploads/2008/09/gnome-terminal-with-tabs.png)

Firefox gets around this in some way I haven't divined. Either it
doesn't use GtkNotebook or the GtkNotebook doesn't contain the pages.
Instead Mozilla seem to have implemented their own paging. For those
using KDE, the message is mixed. [Qt](http://trolltech.com/products/qt/)
is no better - out of the box
[QTabWidget](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qtabwidget.html) places a
similar border around controls placed within it. [Konsole 3.x suffers
from
this](https://help.ubuntu.com/5.10/kubuntu/images/C/kubuntu-konsole.png),
although Konsole 4 & Kate 4 do not. Props to the KDE project. Microsoft
Windows also fairs poorly, though [Office 2007 pulls some new
tricks](http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/08/22/711808.aspx "Jensen Harris: An Office User Interface Blog : Giving You Fitts").
try maximizing Internet Explorer or Outlook.

### How things should be

How can this be fixed? Should it be fixed? GTK+ and Qt implement their
tabbed containers like this for presumably sane reasons, but it makes
these applications harder to use and frankly it looks butt ugly to me.
Many will groan at this, but from what I've seen Mac OS X gets this
right. The lines are clean, applications look very uncluttered and
everything extends to the edge of the window - there are few borders, if
any. For instance, compare this screen shot of
[Adium](http://www.adiumx.com) to the earlier Pidgin screen shots.

[![Adium

I'm want Gnome or KDE to look just like
[Aqua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_(user_interface)), but they
could simplify much along those lines.

### Accessories to the crime

Dead space is present in other areas of the Free desktop. Often around
scrollbars. On Ubuntu, with the Human theme many GTK+ applications,
including Evolution and Synaptic, have padding between lists or text
areas and their scrollbars. Some rehabilitation can be done with the
[gtkrc](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeArt/Tutorials/GtkThemes "GTK+ theme tutorial")
file or an alternative theme such as [Clearlooks
Compact](http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Clearlooks+Compact?content=69357).
More in this next time.
