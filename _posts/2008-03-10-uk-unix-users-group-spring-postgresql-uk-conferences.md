title: 'UK Unix Users Group Spring & Postgresql UK Conferences'
---

The [UKUUG Spring 2008](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/index.html) and
first ever [PostgreSQL UK](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/postgres.html)
conference are soon. The UKUUG conference runs from Monday 31st March
until Wednesday 2nd April, the Postgres event runs for 1 day on the
Wednesday. They're both in
[Birmingham](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/brum.html), at the
[Conservatoire](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/location.html). That's the
same location that held the first PyCon UK, for those of you keeping
track. I'll be speaking on [Extract Transform and Load (ETL) with
Python](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/talk_abstracts.html#14) and soaking
up all I can about PostgreSQL. Officially early bird registration ends
tonight (Monday 10 March). A little bird told me that that the website
won't be updated a night or two. So [book
*now*](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/booking.html) to get the whole 3 day
conference for only £180, inc. UKUUG membership or £140 if you're
already a UKUUG member. See you there. Alex.
