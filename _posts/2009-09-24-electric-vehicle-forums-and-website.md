title: Electric vehicle forums and websites
---

There are quite a few forums on the net for electric bikes, scooters,
motorcycles and cars. Mostly they cover early adopter issues, tinkering,
advocacy and DIY conversions. Here are the ones I've been drawn to:

-   [Endless Sphere](http://endless-sphere.com/forums/index.php), A
    lively forum with an emphasis on electric bikes
-   [V is for Voltage](http://visforvoltage.org/) Another lively forum
    with many posts on scooters and motorcycles, particularly the
    Vectrix
-   [Electric Motoring](http://electricmotoring.forumup.co.uk/) A UK
    forum that's relatively new, it covers mostly imported Chinese
    scooters
-   [Battery Vehicle
    Society](http://www.batteryvehiclesociety.org.uk/forums/) A UK site
    with many posts concerning electric car/van conversions, and
    (unsurprisingly) batteries
-   [Elmoto](http://www.elmoto.net/) A forum dedicated electric
    motorcycles and conversions
-   [DIY Electric Car Forums](http://www.diyelectriccar.com/) Electric
    car conversions galore, including a gallery and blogs

Also for those just dipping their toe, these sites give a nice
overview/introduction:

-   [Autoblog Green](http://green.autoblog.com/) An offshoot of the
    automitive news site Autoblog that covers alternative fuel and fuel
    efficient vehicles

    Mini EV conversion
