title: 'Hacker Culture and geek groups in Birmingham, West Midlands'
---

Birmingham has a vibrant community of geek/enthusiast groups, of which
I'm proud to be a part. That said, it's sometimes hard to find or even
know about all of them, without the right. So collected here are the
groups I know of:

[Birmingham LUG](http://birmingham.lug.org.uk/)
:   Linux User Group that meets at the University of Birmingham, on the
    third Thursday of each month. Meetings are usually a technical talk,
    followed by a drink at the bar on campus.

[Birmingham Perl Mongers](http://birmingham.pm.org/)
:   Perl user group that meets in Birmingham, twice each month
    alternating between technical and socials. Group members hosted the
    [2006 YAPC::Europe Perl
    Conference](http://www.yapceurope.org/2006/), and are major
    contributors to the Perl community.

[Brum2600](http://www.brum2600.net/)
:   Hacker group that meet in Birmingham, on the first Saturday of each
    month. Brum2600 also holds Brumcon, an annual event with speakers
    from around the country and Europe.

    on the first Tuesday and a technical meeting on the third Tuesday.

    every few weeks. Hack Sessions involve electronics projects (esp.
    Arduino), art projects, crafts, mechanics and other varied creative
    activities.

[Mappa Mercia](http://mappa-mercia.org/)
:   [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) mapping group for the
    West Midlands. They hold mapping parties and meet regularly for
    socials. Members have been instrumental in mapping the West Midlands
    so well.
