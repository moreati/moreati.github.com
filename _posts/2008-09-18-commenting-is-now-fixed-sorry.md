title: 'Commenting is now fixed, sorry'
---

Anybody who tried to register on this blog during the last 6 months or
so, would not have received an activation email. So many people will
have been unable to comment. If this has happened to you sorry for the
inconvenience. This Wordpress installation can now send emails, thanks
to the [Configure SMTP
plugin](http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/configure-smtp/) by [Scott
Reilly](http://coffee2code.com/about/). If you have any problems, please
email me, my address is
[alex@moreati.org.uk](mailto:alex@moreati.org.uk).
