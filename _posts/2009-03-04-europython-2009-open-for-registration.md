title: EuroPython 2009 open for registration
---

If you've enjoyed [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org/) the last 2 years, the
bad news is that it won't be happening this year. The good news is
that [EuroPython 2009](http://www.europython.eu/) is coming to sunny
Birmingham instead, for 3 days from Tues 30th June to Thurs 2nd July and
[registration is now open](http://www.europython.eu/registration/). The
even better news is that until 14th March it's *really cheap*, like 50%
off cheap making the 3 day conference only £95. As a warm up, from
Sunday we have 2 days of tutorials at the bargain price of £70. To close
there will be sprints from Friday 3rd July, and in case any Django
coders get home sick it all coincides with the [Birmingham International
Jazz Festival](http://www.birminghamjazzfestival.com/). My talk on
[ArcGIS and IronPython](2009/01/27/from-esriarcgis-import-geodatabase/)
has been approved. So I'll see you there.
