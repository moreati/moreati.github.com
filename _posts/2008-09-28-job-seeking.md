It's been Five years since I moved to Birmngham, to begin work with
[Defence Estates](http://www.defence-estates.mod.uk/). I've enjoyed my
time there, the people are fantastic and I've learnt much. It's now time
to move on; I want to find new challenges and broader horizons. If
you're looking for a DBA, a system administrator, someone skilled in GIS
support, or in application support - then please [email
me](mailto:alex@moreati.org.uk) or call me. My
[CV](/about/Alex%20Willmer%20CV.doc) is online (as
[MS Word](/about/Alex%20Willmer%20CV.doc),
[OpenDocument](/about/Alex%20Willmer%20CV.odt), or
[PDF](/about/Alex%20Willmer%20CV.pdf)).
