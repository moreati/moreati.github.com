title: Taste testing for fun and profit
---

Last week I ran three
[blind taste tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_taste_test)
at a local meetup.
They covered cola, diet cola, and chocolate sandwich bars.
I wanted to find out what goes into running a taste test, how peoeple
react and to get some measurable results.

My inspiration was a recent TV programme called
["Eat Well for Less?"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0520lz9)
In the show families have their normal grocery replaced with
substitutes in plain packaging - most of which are cheaper.
If the family accept the substitutes the annual savings are revealed
and they typically come to thousands of pounds.

My motivation is to explore the possbility of prompting people to save
money on groceries, by encouraging them to blind taste test. Perhaps
as a subscription service.

### Results

Approximately 100 people (majority male) were present.
Some people tried more than one category.
20 tried the cola, 12 tried diet cola, and 18 tried the chocolate.
Cola and diet cola showed a preference for the branded products.

| Product                       | Preferred by |
| ----------------------------- | ------------:|
| Coca Cola                     |           75%|
| Sainsburys Classic Cola       |           25%|

| Product                       | Preferred by |
| ----------------------------- | ------------:|
| Diet Coke                     |           70%|
| Sainsbury's Basics Diet Cola  |           30%|

Chocolate bars showed a small preference for the supermarket own products.

| Product                                       | Preferred by |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------:|
| Penguin Bar                                   |           25%|
| Sainsbury's Basics Chocolate Digestive Bar    |           35%|
| Sainsbury's Polar Bar                         |           35%|

25% of tasters preferred Penguin bars,
35% preferred 
40% preferred Sainsburys Polar Bars

Tasters were also asked how often they shop for groceries, and how much
they spend per trip.
Once multiplied to give annual spending the self reported numbers varied
between £70 per person per year, and £9000 per person per year. Given
the extremely wide range of numbers I did not analyse this further.

### Conclusions

There may be a market for helping people to switch from branded products.
The potential for substituion is likely to vary greatly across 
categories.
Most tasters clerly preferred Coca Cola, but only a minority preferred
Penguin bars. 
Self reported grocery spend is not a reliable measure.
Suggesting people don't realise how much they're spending, and how much
they could save.

### Methodology and limitations

-   The test lasted roughly 2 hours.
-   Tests were only single blind. All packaging was removed and
    items were randomly assigned a three digit number.
    However I knew the products.
-   Drinks were served in 150ml cups, people weren't required to
    drink all of the contents - some took only a sip.
-   Chocolate was served in half-bar portions.
    Most people ate the entire portion.
-   Order of serving was not randomised.
-   People were discouraged from discussing their preferences before
    completing the response form.
-   Tasters weren't provided a way to rinse their mouth between tastings.
-   All colas were poured at the start of the test.
    They went flat within an hour of pouring, half way through the test. 
-   One of the chocolate bars was visually different from the other two.
    Whilst preparing them I discovered the Sainsbury's Basics bars have
    a biscuit filling, rather than a sandwich filling.

### Lessons learned

-   Cola goes flat quickly.
    Pour it as needed, or switch to still drinks.
-   Use smaller servings of drink to avoid waste and standardise
    the quantity consumed.
-   Future tests will need better design to scale up to larger sample
    sizes, and to avoid biases such as
