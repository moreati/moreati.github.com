title: Another Python cheat sheet
---

I couldn't find a Python cheat sheet that I liked, so I made another.

-   [Python cheat sheet 0.1 (A4,
    OpenDocument)](../../../uploads/2008/11/python-cheat-sheet.odt)
-   [Python Cheat sheet 0.1 (A4,
    PDF)](../../../uploads/2008/11/python-cheat-sheet.pdf)

It's rough, but pretty usable. I need to make better use of
space/colour, choose a clearer font and link it into the Python docs.
