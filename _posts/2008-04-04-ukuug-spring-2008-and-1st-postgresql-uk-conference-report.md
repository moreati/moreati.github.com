title: UKUUG spring 2008 and 1st PostgreSQL UK conference report
---

My first UK Unix User Group conference and the first ever Postgres UK
conference ended on Wednesday. Both were successful, reactions I
overheard were good. Dave Page has a posted a
[wrapup](http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dpage/index.php?/archives/54-PG-UK-2008-Wrapup.html).
My favorite talk of the conference has to be [Software patents and open
standards](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/talk_abstracts.html#51) by Pieter
Hintjens. His style was engaging and his words cleared my understanding
and opinion of software patents and more. Expect a post on this matter
soon. There were many more talks on the Wednesday I would have loved to
attend. Audio was recorded for nearly all talks and should be uploaded
soon. A close second is [Explaining
EXPLAIN](http://spring2008.ukuug.org/talk_abstracts.html#50) by Greg
Stark. He gave a concise & understandable talk on a deep subject in a
short timeslot. The slides from all the [postgres
talks](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PG_UK_2008) have been uploaded
already. A The PostgreSQL conference closed with a discussion of
features attendees missed in PostgreSQL and discussion of a conference
goal - to increase the profile of the UK PostgreSQL User Group (ukpug).
The [ukpug mailing
list](http://mail.postgresql.org/mj/mj_wwwusr/domain=postgresql.org?user=&passw=&func=lists-long-full&extra=ukpug)
takes a little tracking down, but please sign up if you're in the UK and
into PostgreSQL.
