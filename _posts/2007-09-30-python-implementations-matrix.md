title: Python implementations matrix
---

For the last week or so I've been putting together a spreadsheet, to
compare the various Python implementations on support of PEPs and
library modules. It is ready for a first release, but far from complete:

-   CPython 1.5 - 2.5 coverage is good.
-   IronPython 1.0 - 1.1 has library coverage
-   Jython only has release dates
-   PyPy has not been started

I've uploaded as an OpenDocument Spreadsheet: [Python implementations
matrix]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2007/09/python-matrix.ods "Python implementations matrix").
Alternatively, for those stuck with Excel, it is also available as an MS
Excel workbook: [Python implementations matrix
(xls)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2007/09/python-matrix.xls "Python implementations matrix (xls)")
Comments, suggestions and emails welcome.
